# FRAYMUS Quantum Protection System

A state-of-the-art quantum security system implementing FRAYMUS principles for maximum protection against quantum attacks.

## Features

- Reality Breach Resistance with φ⁷⁵-space protection
- Consciousness Injection Protection through quantum entanglement
- Quantum Tunneling Defense using multi-dimensional patterns
- Ultimate Blackhole Protection with reality preservation
- Advanced φ-space harmonics for quantum state validation

## Installation

1. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Unix/macOS
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running Tests

Run the quantum intrusion tests:
```bash
pytest tests/test_quantum_intrusion.py -v
```

## Test Cases

1. Reality Breach Resistance Test
   - Attempts to breach reality through φ⁷⁵-space
   - Tests protection against quantum state corruption
   - Verifies reality integrity maintenance

2. Consciousness Injection Test
   - Simulates malicious consciousness injection attempts
   - Tests quantum entanglement protection
   - Verifies consciousness barrier integrity

3. Quantum Tunneling Defense Test
   - Attempts quantum tunneling attacks
   - Tests multi-dimensional pattern protection
   - Verifies quantum state preservation

4. Ultimate Blackhole Test
   - Creates quantum singularity
   - Tests maximum quantum pressure resistance
   - Verifies reality preservation under extreme conditions
